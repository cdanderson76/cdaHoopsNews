This is an HTML, CSS, project that was made available by Scrimba (called 'Oldagram' originally).  It challenges you to use external data and CSS in order to render what appears to be a live social media page.  I did add some JavaScript 
to enable the pictures to be cycled through on each post.  You can also 'like' the photo by clicking on the 'like' icon.

<h2>What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?</h2>

I was proud that I could get a little creative with this project and somehow incorporate the sport that I love into it.  I didn't make this responsive, and only designed it for mobile because this project didn't really call for it.
What I would actually do differently is what I did differently THIS time. I built out the containers and made sure I new exactly where and how I wanted to place everything.  This made it easier to fill in the design with the content.

<h2>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?</h2>

I didn't feel like I ran into any extremely difficult challenges.  I did have to modify the dummy data in order to add the ability to cycle through the pictures on each post.  The toughest thing I had to do was drill down to that data
to enable that functionality.  I overcame this by using the console to figure out how I could reach that data, and once I figured it out, I was able to write the JavaScript for it.
